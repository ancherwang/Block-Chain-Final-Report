## Hedging capabilities of cryptocurrencies: Can cryptocurrencies hedge or diversify portfolio?
## Abstract
This review hopes to explore the hedging and diversification capabilities of crypto currencies represented by Bitcoin. Overall speaking， previous researches indicated a negative attitudes towards the hedging function of crypto currencies since no significant negative correlation is shown. Meanwhile, crypto currencies may be a suitable diversifier due to its low correlation with all the other assets. In some specific region, mostly Asian Pacific area, Crypto currencies behaved stonger hedging or diversifications partly due to investors's different preference. Very few of the accepted hedging timing may be extreme recessions or unrests when the value of fiat currencies is doubted. Researches also indicated crypto currencies should be a good hedge against economic policies uncertainty. 

However, the high volatility and low liquidity add much difficulties on the hedging or diversification operations.Due to the maturation of the crypto currencies market and as the price of crypto currencies go back to rationality, the hedging or diversification plan using crypto currencies may not be profitable any more. And the dissatisfying historical data and the performance of the crypto currencies hedge fund may be an alarm that the theoretical hedge or diversification capabilities is actually meaningless when the asset is undergoing a bearish market. To conclude, the major function of Bitcoin till now in financial investment is mainly speculative not a rational hedging or diversification tool.
## Introduction
A cryptocurrency is the digital asset designed to be a medium of exchange in online trading, asset transfer or varication. Its characteristic of decentralized control opposed to centralized system in reality guarantee its security and eliminate the risks resulted from this traditional economic pattern. Used in a narrow sense, cryptocurrencies started from Bitcoin in 2009. (Some publication include the QQ coins or other online top-up cards in this definition from a broader sense). And the market value of bitcoin has risen to over 94 billion till May,2019（Data from https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/).After exploring for a decade, still cryptocurrencies are still mysterious to many investors. It is very difficult to understand the value of cryptocurrencies, which could be measured by the liquidity, reactivity to the variance of other assets as well as the hedging abilities of the asset.The speculative nature and the decentralized characteristic all add difficulties to the analysis. Relative researches had been conducted to explore the crypto currencies nature, trading pattern and its value as a diversifier or hedging tool, which will be introduced in the literature review part.  

Here comes another problem, what is the difference between hedge and diversification? As illustrated in Baur and Lucey (2010), a diversifier is an asset that has a weak positive correlation with another asset on average. A weak (strong) hedge is an asset that is uncorrelated (negatively corre- lated) with another asset on average. In this whole review, we would follow this difinition to explore.
## Literature Review
Corbet, Lucey, Urquhart and Yarovaya (2018) show that Bitcoin’s role in international diversification has been a controversial research topic among scholars and practitioners because of the importance of having policy impact in asset allocation, hedging and risk management. Indeed, investors and portfolio managers are always looking for alternative investments targets which could reduce the downside risk of traditional assets. As bitcoin became the first crypto currency, investors and academics began testing its ability to diversify its traditional assets because it was independent of sovereign authorities and economic/financial developments.This is also supported by evidence of unique factors driving the price of bitcoin, such as social emotions (Bouoiyour&Selmi, 2015;Kristoufek, 2015, exchange volume and hash rate (Bouoiyour&Selmi, 2015), energy price (Hayes, 2017), user anonymity (Ober, Katzenbeisser, &Hamacher, 2013), computer programming hobbyist support (Yelowitz&Wilson, 2015), technology (Li&Wang, 2017), cyber attacks (Bohme, Christin, Edelman, &Moore, 2013)(2015), increasing the uncertainty of the stock market (Bouri, Gupta, et al., 2017), and uncertainty over economic policy (Demir et al., 2018).  

Using the univariate GARCH model, Dyhrberg (2016) shows that bitcoin can be used as a hedge between the FTSE index and the dollar exchange rate.Bouri Molnar et al.(2017) adopted DCC-Garch model and regression analysis involving quantile dummies were used to show that bitcoin can diversify extreme downward movements in stock returns. Using a very similar approach, Baur et al.(2018) demonstrates the weak correlation between bitcoin and stocks, implies the ability to diversify during normal and stressful times, and that bitcoin is 'primarily used as a speculative investment rather than as an alternative currency and medium of exchange.'Using the multivariable GARCH model, Guesmi et al.(2018) shows that adding bitcoin to a portfolio of gold and crude oil stocks results in a lower risk of portfolio gains than the same portfolio excluding bitcoin.Ji et al. reported similar results for bitcoin's ability to hedge.(2018), they used the graph theory method and variance decomposition metric.Corbet, Meegan, Larkin, et al.(2018) use connectivity measures in the time and frequency domains and provide evidence similar to those found in the above study;That said, bitcoin is largely independent of the global financial system and traditional assets, and thus can offer valuable diversification benefits.However, Klein, Pham Thu and Walther (2018) applied some methods and found that the conditional variance attribute of bitcoin is different from that of Gold.In particular, they see bitcoin moving in tandem with the stock market's decline.In addition, their portfolio analysis shows that bitcoin has a volatile hedging capability.  

Many previous studies have focused on the direct correlation between bitcoin and traditional assets such as stocks, commodities and bonds, and reported evidence of very weak correlation (Baur et al., 2018;Bouri, Molnar et al., 2017;Corbet, Meegan, Larkin et al., 2018;Guesmi et al., 2018;Ji et al., 2018).However, the correlation between bitcoin and traditional assets related to macroeconomic variables such as EPU is still poorly understood.In addition, it is unclear whether the hedging effect of bitcoin is affected by the EPU status.In order to solve these problems, the garch-midas model (Engle et al., 2013) and its extension dcc-midas (Colacito et al., 2011) seem to be an appropriate modeling framework.These models have been widely used in the financial literature.Indeed, they continue to attract academic interest because they are able to break down volatility and correlations into long-term and short-term components and combine data from different frequency levels, such as monthly levels of global uncertainty.

## Cryptocurrencies and gold, are they comparable?
The birth of crypto currencies made people think of gold. Indeed, they both have scarcity of supply and therefore, leads to their value derived from this scarcity. Besides, the supply is not regulated by government, thus the supply is of high volatility and is finite. 
We all know gold is a good hedging assets against stocks, bonds or other assets. From the figure shown below, we can notice the return rate of gold has different trends compared with US stocks, which make gold a good hedging tool.
#### Figure 1: Return rate on different assets within recent years
![Figure 1](https://github.com/ancherwang/Block-Chain-Final-Report/blob/master/1.Returns%20on%20different%20assets.png?raw=true)

However the truth is the hedging ability of crypto currencies is not as good as gold according to the historical performance eventhough their characteristic share so many similarities. This review will explain in the later parts.
## Empiracal test of hedging and diversification capabilities of cryptocurrencies from previous researches
In this part, we mainly look at two models and their outcome. The first one is Dyhrberg(2015)'s Garch model, the outcome indicated the potential hedging capabilities against certain assets. The second one is the dynamic conditional correlation model from Bouri et al. (2016). The result suggest Bitcoin is a poor hedge and is suitable for diversification purposes only. Here are the specific introduction.
### Threshold-Garch model of Bitcoin investment and FTSE index & exchange rates
Capie et al. (2005) assumed that the errors exhibited conditional autoregressive heteroscedasticity and therefore adopted asymmetric GARCH models to find volatility correlations. Besides, Engle’s LaGrange multiplier test also showed high ARCH effects in the residuals of the bitcoin return which makes GARCH modelling suitable for relative research. So Dahrberg also adopted this method.

It is important to estimate asymmetric models to be able to describe the dynamic relationship between the variables in question. There is a tendency among time series for volatility to decline when return increase and rise when returns decrease, known as the leverage effect which makes asymmetry crucial in modelling. The models in this research also distinguishes between the contemporaneous and lagged shock effects which is important in analysis. Asymmetric models will additionally be used to ensure comparability with the results from previous research. The variables included will however be different so direct comparability between coefficients are not possible. Combined all the requirements above, finally the Threshold-Garch model became the most eligible model.

![Figure 2](https://github.com/ancherwang/Block-Chain-Final-Report/blob/master/2.%20Data%20from%20model%201.png?raw=true)

#### Table 1: Statistic summary in T-Garch model
![Figure 3](https://github.com/ancherwang/Block-Chain-Final-Report/blob/master/3.%20Model%201%20statistic%20summary.png?raw=true)

To eliminate the possible reverse causality and endogeneity, or in another words, the possibility that the model should include contemporaneous and lagged values of the Financial Times Stock Exchange Index in the mean equation, which is shown below.

![Figure 4](https://github.com/ancherwang/Block-Chain-Final-Report/blob/master/4.%20Model%201%201st%20function.png?raw=true)

This paper also propose a hedging against dollar Threshold-Garch model, which measures the correlation of Bitcoin price and currencies. The method is similar as the above, and we can see the function used here transformed to the following format.

![Figure 5](https://github.com/ancherwang/Block-Chain-Final-Report/blob/master/5..%20Model%201%202nd%20function.png?raw=true)

Mean equation (3) and variance equation (4) for the dollar-euro exchange rate and (5) and (6) for the dollar-sterling exchange rates.
The model results are shown as follow.
#### T-Garch model for bitcoin and FTSE index
##### Table 2: T-GARCH(1,1) with FTSE Index and return on bitcoin investment
![Figure 6](https://github.com/ancherwang/Block-Chain-Final-Report/blob/master/6.%20Bitcoin-FTSE%20index%20model.png?raw=true)

The conclusion is obvious, the outcome of the model showed little correlation between FTSE index and bitcoin price. Therefore, it is safe to conclude the stock market performance and bitcoin price have very little relationship, which provides the possibility to use the bitcoin as a diversification tool for equity investors.

#### T-Garch model for exchange rate
##### Table 3: T-GARCH(1,1) with exchange rate and return on bitcoin investment
![Figure 7](https://github.com/ancherwang/Block-Chain-Final-Report/blob/master/7.%20Bitcoin-exchange%20rate%20model.png?raw=true)

The result for currencies exchange rate is slightly different. Here we can see the t-1 time period exchange rate still has certain relationship with Bitcoin price. This is very interesting result. Actually the paper and I could not find a suitable explanation for this outcome. But since there exits certain relationship, we can conclude bitcoin may only be suitable for short-time hedging against dollars. However, there comes another problem, due to the high volatility of bitcoin and its high price, I am a little skeptical about its hedging potential. Therefore, as the t-Garch model shows, maybe using crypto currencies to hedge against fiat currencies is not a great idea.

### Dynamic conditional correlation model of bitcoin and other assets
Bouri et.al (2016) researched through a broader field. This publication used a dynamic conditional correlation model to examine whether Bitcoin can act as a hedge and safe haven for major world stock indices, bonds, oil, gold, the general commodity index and the US dollar index. The result suggest Bitcoin is a poor hedge and is suitable for diversification purposes only. However, Bitcoin can only serve as a strong safe haven against weekly extreme down movements in certain area, like China stock market. When the trading frequency changes, the principle determined index would totally change.

#### Data and method of dynamic conditional correlation model
This paper adopted the dynamic conditional correlation model, by which the researchers estimated the correlation between each return series and conducted the regression to evaluate the hedging and diversifying capabilities of Bitcoin. That is because compared with other Garch model, dynamic conditional correlation model could better capture the time-varying and dynamic relationships across return series with fewer com- putational complications. Datasets include the prices of Bitcoin and several financial assets, which include stocks, bonds, currencies and commodities from 2011 to 2015. All the daily and weekly data are from Thomson Reuters DataStream. 

The simulation of the model includes three steps, firstly, a univariate GARCH (1,1) model is estimated. Secondly, a time-varying correlation matrix is computed using the standardized residuals from the previous estimation. To ensure that the selected dynamic conditional correlation model is well fitted, diagnostics tests should be done to test the existence of autocorrelation and heteroscedasticity in the return series.

Lastly and most importantly, to assess the extent to which Bitcoin could be a good hedging or diversification tool, we should extract the dynamic conditional correlations the dynamic conditional correlation model into separate time series and then regressed on dummy variables (D) representing extreme movements in the lower 10th, 5th or 1st percentile of the return distribution.
#### Outcome of dynamic conditional correlation model
##### Table 4: Estimation results on the hedge and safe haven properties of Bitcoin.
![Figure 8](https://github.com/ancherwang/Block-Chain-Final-Report/blob/master/8.model%202%20results.png?raw=true)

As explained by the researcher, the model is well fitted for the question. Panel A of Table presents the coeﬃcient estimates from the regression model speciﬁed in Eq. 5 for daily data. Panel B of Table presents the same estimates for weekly data. 
##### Daily analysis
As shown in panel A, Bitcoin cannot be considered as a weak or strong safe haven against extreme movements in any of the assets on a daily basis. However, Bitcoin may be a strong hedge against Japanese and Asia Pacific stock markets. Furthermore, statistical evidence shows that Bitcoin is a strong hedge for the commodity index, which suggested the strong ability of crypto currencies to reduce risks associated with adverse events in commodities.
##### Weekly analysis
Panel B of outcome table showed that Bitcoin is a strong hedge only against Chinese stocks, considering that the m0 coefficient is significantly negative. Asian investors seem to invest more money on Bitcoin due to the stock market recession due to its decentralized characteristic. Besides, the incremental acceptance and decrease in transaction costs also helps in the growth of bitcoin market in Asian Pacific area.
##### Comparison between daily and weekly results
The trading frequency really matters to investors in the Bitcoin market, as the hedging and safe haven properties of Bitcoin differed across time horizons. For example, the hedging role of Bitcoin for Japanese stocks in daily data fades when using weekly data. The huge price fluctuation and the speculative nature in crypto currencies may explain the result. And the determinants of daily price of weekly price could be totally different.

Therefore, we may conclude the diversification ability of crypto currencies are not constant over time. This needs further studies on the time-varying characteristics of hedging or diversifications properties of Bitcoin.  

## Perspective from industry
### JP Morgan’s Perspective: Cryptocurrencies as portfolio diversification: questionable, despite low correlations
John Normand, head of cross-asset fundamental strategy department in JP Morgan has done long-term follow-up research about the diversification capability of crypto currency. His finding is hedgers should rely on crypto currencies too much despite the historical return and low correlation with major assets. Firstly, the limited liquidity compared with legal tender make it impractical to hedge over other assets. Secondly, people still doubt its risk-return performance and characteristics even though in recent days the risk-adjusted return has increased. Since the history of crypto currencies is very short, the return rate in the price discovery stage could be very high. However in the future, the return may move back to average level and could not offset the high volatility any more.
#### Figure 3: Cryptocurrencies can be 10 times more volatile than core markets like Equities or hedges such as commodities
![Figure 9](https://github.com/ancherwang/Block-Chain-Final-Report/blob/master/9.%20Realized%20volatility%20of%20bitcoin%20and%20other%20assets.png?raw=true)

#### Figure 4: Figure: Bitcoin has failed as a heaven for S&P 500 index 10-worst months since 2010
![Figure 10](https://github.com/ancherwang/Block-Chain-Final-Report/blob/master/10.%20questionable%20hedge.jpg?raw=true)
Besides all the above perspectives, the most strong argument is that according to historical data, during the 10 worst stock months in stock market from 2010 to 2018, only 3 of 10 months witnessed the positive return of Bitcoin, while during the same time period, gold realized 7 of 10 months’ positive return.

From another perspective, over the past 2018 year, correlation of Bitcoin and all other markets has been close to zero. For hedging purposes Bitcoin appears to have an advantage over the yen or gold. However, if the hedging asset itself is in a bear market, then low correlation has no significance.
## When Can Cryptocurrencies used to be a hedging tool
Despite the disadvantages we previously discussed, for those who may concern the possibility of extreme macroeconomics or market stress, crypto currencies may be an option to consider. Crises of confidence around government-issued fiat currencies or the payments system are two scenarios against which cryptocurrencies could insure, with the first occurring due to a hyperinflation and the second in a failed nation-state (think Arab Spring or EMU Crisis). Even though cryptocurrencies haven’t existed for long enough to test their usefulness during recessions, inflationary upturns or regime failures, hedgers might hope that a low or inverse correlations with traditional asset classes over the past several years could improve portfolio efficiency more than customary hedges.

Besides, Bitcoin hedge economic policy uncertainty as people regard crypto currencies a potential hedge under extreme recessions.Uncertainties about the decisions of governments and regularity entities lead to decreases in the trust of investors to fiat currencies and or to the entire economy especially after the global ﬁnancial crisis of around 2008. This is also the time period when the Bitcoin was created. Needless to say, the Bitcoin has the nature questions the eﬀectiveness of conventional economic and ﬁnancial structures and the digital currencies are decentralized secure alternatives to the ﬁat currencies, especially during the times of eco-nomic and geopolitical unrest. Demir（2018）explored the answer of this question by analyzing the the prediction power of the daily economic policy uncertainty (EPU) index on the daily Bitcoin returns. The finding is Bitcoin can serve as a hedging tool against uncertainty at both lower and higher quantiles. In other words, an increase in EPU will help Bitcoin to meet what it promises and increase the attractiveness of Bitcoin. Mostly the Bitcoin returns are negatively associated with the changes in the EPU. However, Bitcoin can be used a hedging tool against uncertainty in extreme times of uncertainty since we also found that the eﬀect is positive and signiﬁcant at the higher quantiles.

Shan et.al(2019) conducted the supplementary research. They combined the Garch model and quantile regression with dummy variables which include extreme conditions to test the reaction of bitcoin market to the EPU shocks. The result is correspondent with findings of previous researches. Bitcoin could not be a strong hedge only except for when the conventional financial market is undergoing a crisis or recession. Indeed investors could find a weak hedging capacity of crypto currencies against EPU.

## Actual outcome of crypto currencies implied by specialized hedging fund
We cannot know the specific yield and their operations of certain hedge fund, but the average return rate of the hedge fund specialized in crypto currencies could be an alarm. Also those conventional financial investment institutions, like Sequoia Capital, are gradually loosing confidence in longing crypto currencies as a hedging tool.

The reality is harsh. As in 2018, when the macroeconomics is poor, the crypto currencies and traditional financial market both behave terribly. We can notice the emergence of crypto currencies hedge fund in recent years. However, their performance could not support the idea that crypto currencies is a useful hedging tool.

The actual near term performance of the cryptocurrency hedge funds has been dismal, broadly speaking, since their inception. This may be attributable to the decline in value of all traded cryptocurrencies, both for the flagship Bitcoin as well as for its alternatives, the altcoins. By the end of the first quarter of 2018 (1Q18), the universal bearish outlook, and its high volatility, and downward momentum of cryptocurrencies, has already led to the closure of many hedge funds. The average performance of crypto hedge funds can be estimated to be  -20% returns yield to date.

For other financial market agents, the decision has been to renege on earlier plans to enter the crypto currencies market. Most people have realized the great future downside potential. For example, the famous Sequoia and Polychain Capital, have decided against conducting a Canadian initial public offering in January.
