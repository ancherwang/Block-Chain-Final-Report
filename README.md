## Introduction
A cryptocurrency is the digital asset designed to be a medium of exchange in online trading, asset transfer or varication. Its characteristic of decentralized control opposed to centralized system in reality guarantee its security and eliminate the risks resulted from this traditional economic pattern. Used in a narrow sense, cryptocurrencies started from Bitcoin in 2009. (Some publication include the QQ coins or other online top-up cards in this definition from a broader sense). And the market value of bitcoin has risen to over 94 billion till May,2019（Data from https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/).After exploring for a decade, still cryptocurrencies are still mysterious to many investors. It is very difficult to understand the value of cryptocurrencies, which could be measured by the liquidity, reactivity to the variance of other assets as well as the hedging abilities of the asset.The speculative nature and the decentralized characteristic all add difficulties to the analysis. Relative researches had been conducted to explore the crypto currencies nature, trading pattern and its value as a diversifier or hedging tool, which will be introduced in the literature review part.
Here comes another problem, what is the difference between hedge and diversification? As illustrated in Baur and Lucey (2010), a diversifier is an asset that has a weak positive correlation with another asset on average. A weak (strong) hedge is an asset that is uncorrelated (negatively corre- lated) with another asset on average. In this whole review, we would follow this difinition.
